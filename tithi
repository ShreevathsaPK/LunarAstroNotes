Pratipada (Sun)(Padya):Kameshwari Devi.
Desire, what I want in my life. Fire element governs them. They want things right now.They either become friends or enemies very quickly.Make their opinoins very quickly.
Don't have time. THese r the ones who changed world by their revolutionary ideas.These r people who want to start things on their own.Chases one goal after another without
any end, they don't sit and relax and enjoy what they have achieved. They can't sit in one place.They don't retire.Statrted new systems. People who have changes eras.Take great
pride in bringing down the old systems.ex: KN Rao. They never backdwon once they start doing something.Krihsna paksh much better than SHukla paksh. Shukla paksha very favourable
to governemnt coz very close to governemtn under govt control whereas in Krishna paskh , they r out of control of Sun.Bullish mindset. If someone challenges on their ego , they r
on different level. King Bali had conquered everything except swarga, but he wanted swarga nd didn't want what he had.But still he chased and tried to conquer the swarga but he lost
everything.Very particular about background lineage. Exessive desire will make u comeback to zero. They put pressure on other people as they are not getting what they want. They don't
have friends they just have goal partner.
