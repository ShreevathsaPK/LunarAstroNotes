Navami(Kalasundari): People who are extremely bounded by rituals,family values,who carry lineage.follows the tradition not able to break it.I cannot break the rules if the other is playing by bad rules.
Fear of getting Bad family name.Lot of pressure within the family.Family drama, even if people are putting blockage not fighting back.These people when they go out of their comfort zone,
they are extremely sensitive. Just like how confident ram was in Dandakaranya as its his land/comfort zone. Idea of fighting is not for Navami tithi.
These people cannot claim their right even if it belongs to them.That's why Leo Dagdh raashi.
Another Dagdh raashi: Scorpio. To leave anyone,to kill anyone, its not their cup of tea.leaving people telling goodbye , its very difficult for this people.
They are like this kid " I know the answer in the class but I was not able to say, I was confused..I was able to answer but I didn't want insult anyone..too sensitive.".
Extremely sensitive people towards feelings.
They open their eyes and look like they are crying.
